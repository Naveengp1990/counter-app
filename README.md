## üöÄ About the Project

The Counter App is a minimalist web application demonstrating fundamental front-end interactivity. It features a simple user interface with a button and a numerical display. Each click of the button increments the displayed number by one, showcasing basic DOM manipulation and event handling using vanilla JavaScript. This project is ideal for understanding the core concepts of client-side web development.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Single-Button Interaction:** A dedicated button (`#increment-btn`) to trigger the counter increment.
*   **Real-time Display:** The current counter value is displayed dynamically in an element (`#counter-value`).
*   **Simple Logic:** Increments the counter by `1` with each button click.
*   **Static Page:** Built as a static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript page, requiring no server-side processing.
*   **Responsive Design:** (Implicitly, as it's a simple layout)
